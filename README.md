# sccs-vvd-hd
Release of my sccs-heightmaps-virtualdesktop-SharpDX11.1 repository. Trying to rebuild my projects from scratch. I developed a new project sccsscriptrewrite in order to have c# read and write new files from memory to "clean" if any steganography was how my projects/solutions/scripts were infested.
