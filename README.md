# sccs-vvd-hd
Re-Release of my sccs-heightmaps-virtualdesktop-SharpDX11.1 repository as it was and 2 other repos, filled with garbage cookies leftovers spywares/adwares/viruses/malware and i felt it was the time to finally restart from scratch as i do not have any sofware that "cleans" steganography from my files at my disposition. I am trying to clean the best way as i go and will try and release my softwares without those goddamn maleficent cookie leftovers or copy paste steganography from using as reference code on the internet?

My goal for my current development is to have clean projects releases, all the time. I am tired of those goddamn spywares and malwares and viruses sitting somehwere in my computer and suddenly reviving itself to be stenographed on my scripts or something. I never am putting spywares and malwares and viruses in my scripts. So where in the fuck are those things coming from? And the only thing i point to, is copy pasting code from the internet using it as reference in our code and ending up not using it but keeping it sometimes is a very bad habbit. Another very bad habbit is to not have an antivirus installed on the computer that tells you the moment that a library downloaded from github is dirty. So my library Win32.DWMSharedSurface was dirty. There was a goddamn dropper virus/spyware/malware on it, and github users probably got fedup of this shit and my last revision under MIT was probably infected too... So i closed my 3 repositories of my big projects in low-level barebone because i don't want people to get infected. Don't follow my bad habbit of not installing an antivirus. Now i have one. But also, I developed a new project sccsscriptrewrite in order to have c# read and write new files from memory to "clean" if any steganography was how my projects/solutions/scripts were infested, since i am telling myself, if i read the file from c# and put it in a string, and then write the file to a .txt extension, wouldn't any embedded characters of steganography whatever/however it's done be also pasted onto the text file and down on my hard drive which could give me visibility on where the hidden dirty parcels of code are in my code. Any other code not commented would give me errors then when i exchange cleaned/rewritten scripts for non-cleaned ones in my solution in visual studio. Otherwise how in the heck and where in the heck is it lodging itself and how can we get rid of them? Unless they are false positive and i am just too worried and that i need to binary sign my files/scripts.

In the meantime while i produce my next revision, you can watch the current status of my old now rotten/closed/shelved release and new project release submitted through the possible malware/infected portal of microsoft windows defender.

EDIT2023AVRIL17 - I released/uploaded my solution REV1312. Now i am naming my solutions sccsvvdhd instead of sccsr14forms or sccsr15-16-17 etc... but those revision numbers will reappear when i make backups of my solution and release them as i did in this current repository with my first release. I wanted to remake from scratch my solutions WinRT.GraphicsCapture and Win32.Shared and Win32.DWMSharedSurface before releasing and so i did. Those are freshly "rewritten scripts from c# by using my sccsscriptrewrite utility solution", where i don't even know if it works, and also rebuilt solutions from scratch using visual studio 2022 and the framework 4.7.2 for those as using the framework 4.8 or net6.0 wasn't working.
