UPLOADED UNDER APACHE 2.0 LICENSE and all of the other licenses included in the folder Licenses. This does not change that my earlier revisions were not under a main Apache 2.0 License but were under MIT license and the other licenses included in the folder Licenses of my old repository sccs-heightmaps-virtualdesktop-SharpDX11.1. But this repository is different in terms that I want the Apache 2.0 License to englobe the rest. The idea of putting these series of softwares/codes/references together and using the Apache 2.0 License and using ProtectMyWork i think is a better way to protect the project.

# sccs-vvd-hd
This is a repository for the continuation of my work, on my voxel virtual desktop. I closed my repository sccs-heightmaps-virtualdesktop-SharpDX11.1 because i became tired of "false positive" trojan horses and other spywares and malwares that are detected by Microsoft's Defender submission page when i upload my scripts and programs through their detection software that tags some of my scripts as viruses/spywares. Also avira and probably other antivirus/antispywares were finding supposed viruses/spywares/malwares in my code somewhere where there is nothing on the screen. How is this even possible to open a basic shader with 25 lines of code and have a virus in it? steganography? or false positives since a shader let's say of the same code inside of a virus, was already sorted by the microsoft defender database, and it is tagging my shaders as viruses/spywares/malwares because at microsoft defender they don't do their jobs properly and they tag everything as viruses/malwares forcing the developer to purchase additional licenses, in this case code signing certificates, that we have to purchase in order for our code to be "tagged" non-virus/non-spyware/non-malware/non-trojan in the viruses database worldwide. Talk about a cheap way to make some money, when all they could do is investigate my code and they would find that i am only building a nice platform for voxelizing surfaces, digital surfaces where a texture2d and the bytes contained within the image are retrieved in order to display it in voxels onscreen is what i do. And i thought to make of this repository more organized, cleaner code (working on it), more info, screenshots that are in the revision folder instead of the main page as i used to do with the projekt screenshots.

My repository sccs-heightmaps-virtualdesktop-SharpDX11.1 and 2 other repos, were filled with garbage cookies leftovers maybe like spywares/adwares/viruses/malware and i felt it was the time to finally restart from scratch as i do not have any sofware that "cleans" steganography from my files at my disposition. I am trying to clean the best way as i go and will try and release my softwares without those goddamn maleficent cookie leftovers or copy paste steganography from using as reference code on the internet? 

My goal for my current development is to have clean projects releases, all the time. I am tired of those goddamn spywares and malwares and viruses sitting somehwere in my computer and suddenly reviving itself to be stenographed on my scripts or something. I never am putting spywares and malwares and viruses in my scripts. So where in the fuck are those things coming from? And the only thing i point to, is copy pasting code from the internet using it as reference in our code and ending up not using it but keeping it sometimes is a very bad habbit. Another very bad habbit is to not have an antivirus installed on the computer that tells you the moment that a library downloaded from github is dirty. So my library Win32.DWMSharedSurface was dirty. There was a goddamn dropper virus/spyware/malware on it, and github users probably got fedup of this shit and my last revision under MIT was probably infected too... So i closed my 3 repositories of my big projects in low-level barebone because i don't want people to get infected. Don't follow my bad habbit of not installing an antivirus. Now i have one. But also, I developed a new project sccsscriptrewrite in order to have c# read and write new files from memory to "clean" if any steganography was how my projects/solutions/scripts were infested, since i am telling myself, if i read the file from c# and put it in a string, and then write the file to a .txt extension, wouldn't any embedded characters of steganography whatever/however it's done be also pasted onto the text file and down on my hard drive which could give me visibility on where the hidden dirty parcels of code are in my code? But right now i am directly writting to a .cs extension and not to a .txt extension. Any other code not commented would give me errors if i would maybe write to a .txt extension and save the file and then reload the .txt and then write to a .cs extension ? Wouldn't reloading fresh written c# code from c# with garbled uncommented programming language be enough to cause an error in visual studio when loading the scripts i thought? for sure i thought. Not sure if in theory it would work. Otherwise how in the heck and where in the heck is it lodging itself and how can we get rid of them? Unless they are false positive and i am just too worried and that i need to binary sign my files/scripts.

#In the meantime while i produce my next revision, you can watch the current status of my old now rotten/closed/shelved release and new project release submitted #through the malware/infected portal of microsoft windows defender. note... it looks like those reviews/results of the submission through microsoft defender are account linked so i will post screenshots later.

Not sure that my ratios are correctly fitting the description of the ratios that i put in my script.
