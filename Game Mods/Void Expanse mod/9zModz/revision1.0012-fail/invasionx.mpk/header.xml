There is still a bug with serialization of the savegame and it is a needle in a haystack to find it. I will keep working on it. But for the moment, if the game crashes at save, you will need to reload the server and use your latest save.
Also, i forgot to put a custom icon for the new Salvaging device.

Edit 2020-08-15 fixes:
Removed a unused item.
Added icon for the salvaging device and made it available through the shop.
fixed rc drones not working.</description>
