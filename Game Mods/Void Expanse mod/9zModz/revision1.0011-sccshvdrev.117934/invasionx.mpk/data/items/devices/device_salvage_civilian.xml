		<title>Salvaging device replica</title>
		<description>in the years 2010 to 2020 something, in the United States in 1978 and then a South Korean company found ways to recharge batterys at a distance. Improvements in the electromagnetic induction with nano tech drones
			have made so that the companies started using that funnel to send the input back where it came from in an infinite loop of a funnel with 2 electromagnetic directions. But leaving
			earth after the great alien attack, all sorts of artists surviving in escape ships and leading to these new worlds have tried to mimic the technology and some of those fake engineers are failing to 
			negate, inside of the receiver, the effects of sending an electromagnetic induction funnel and, unfortunately, this device is sending the salvageable part towards your ship where the electromagnetic funnel started from.
			other devices are actually pushing the salvageable part away. Every time that this device is shot, it sends a receiver end on the salveable part and then the process of nano tech salvaging begins. Moving
 			too far will deactivate the salvaging unit otherwise your ship's energy would drain, as the more energy is needed the more the distance with the target salvable object, and so it is limited to work from a
 			certain distance from the salvaging part. </description>
