# revision 13135 - calibration update - halfway there

hey everyone, i was able to calibrate approx 75 resolutions on 150. It's all of the low voxel definition resolutions that i worked on but out the 75 resolutions i calibrated, i will review 13 of those as i am unsure, and wrote next to the resolutions "to review" in the script scgraphicssec.cs. So currently, you should only use the "half voxel res" option, and it is set as default, as i didn't calibrate the "full voxel res" yet, where the voxel HD resolutions are. So currently, the engine runs smooth on multiple resolutions where the screencapture and the voxels are "calibrated" correctly positioned meaning the holes of the heightmaps are where the color values are on the displayed image. I am unsure if i will start the "full voxel resolution" calibration today the 30th of april 2023, as it really was a marathon just to calibrate the first 75 resolutions in two days.
