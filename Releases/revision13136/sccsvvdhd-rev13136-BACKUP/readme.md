please read the sccsvvdhd-info-revision13136-1.pdf

But please note that my project currently has many unfinished things that you could call bugs. For instance:

1. The perspective projection mode does not work currently. Only the orthogonal projection works but it was working in my earlier revision under my repository sccs-heightmaps-virtualdesktop-SharpDX11.1 . But since i rebuilt my program and tried to clean my shaders, i am slowly but surely will be fixing it soon back to a working state. This is a problem with my vertex shader.
2. The color of the light isn't changing currently when changing colors through the color picker. Since i have rebuilt my program and tried to clean my shaders, i am slowly but surely will be fixing it soon back to a working state. This is a problem with my pixel shader.
3. The supposed "cursor light" isn't really a cursor light anymore it seems. I know, i will fix it soon and bring it back to it's working state soon. Since i have rebuilt my program and tried to clean my shaders, i am slowly but surely will be fixing it soon back to a working state. This is a problem with my pixel shader. 
4. The "high voxel resolution" only works for the microsoft windows 11 session resolution of 1920 by 1080 currently. That was discussed in my revision 1.3135 that i only had the time to calibrate the "low voxel resolution" on the different microsoft windows 11 session resolutions of 800 by 600 to 1920 by 1080 only. Not below yet, not above yet.
