please read the sccsvvdhd-info-revision13136-1.pdf

But please note that my project currently has many unfinished things. For instance:

1. The perspective projection mode does not work currently. Only the orthogonal projection works.
2. The color of the light isn't changing currently when changing colors through the color picker.
3. The "high voxel resolution" only works for the windows session resolution of 1920 by 1080 currently. That was discussed in my revision 1.3135 that i only had the time to calibrate the "low voxel resolution" on the different window session resolutions of 800 by 600 to 1920 by 1080 only. Not below, not above.
