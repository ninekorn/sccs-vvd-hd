update - revision 13134 - full resolution - uncalibrated
Hey everyone. My earlier resolution development / update revision 13133 was pure garbage as the only way possible to have a working resolution was to put the monitor at the resolution prior to selecting it inside of the program. I made changes so that at least 5 resolutions are available for each type of monitor resolutions. So currently my monitor goes from 800w600h to max1920w1080h so i could setup pretty much every resolutions inbetween including the min and max for a total of 15 resolutions, but with each monitor resolution you can select 5 different resolution, but that is not all, since i have also left enabled the "low voxel res" and "high voxel res" options, now named "half voxel res" and "full voxel res", so it's 15 monitor resolutions with 5 choices each (less voxels per resolution type and different ratios per resolution alternative from 1 to 5), and a full voxel and half voxel mode. That brings a total of 15*5*2 voxel resolutions, or 150 voxel resolutions total. But there is so much tweaking left to do, that probably only half of those resolutions are correctly-ish calibrated where the heightmaps values are fitting the screencapture image behind. So i will keep working on this.

I apologize for my last update as even the "low voxel res" and "high voxel res" weren't working anymore. so update 13133 wasn't that decent but at least it gave a little bit of resolutions.

Currently, it is not possible to have access to monitor resolutions other than the current monitor resolutions, so while you would be let's say in the monitor resolution 1920w 1080h, then the voxel resolutions available to you would be 5 * 2 = 10 resolutions possible.
